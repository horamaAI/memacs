- todos as 'projects' :: anything (headline, topic, etc.) that contains one
  or more 'TODOs' *is* a project
  => make a project (headline for example), and add a common task for
  several tasks of the same kind (ex: watch videos). List with '[ ]'
  minimal subtasks => task is completed when all the subtasks are
  marked as completed
