** General
- PDS :: Personal Data Server, hosting repo content for atproto accounts
- DID :: 
* Feed generator
** In a nutshell
- the general flow of providing a custom algorithm to a user is as follows:
  + A user requests a feed from their server (PDS) using the at-uri of the declared feed
  + The PDS resolves the at-uri and finds the DID doc of the Feed Generator
  + The PDS sends a getFeedSkeleton request to the service endpoint declared in the Feed Generator's DID doc
  + This request is authenticated by a JWT (json web token) signed by the user's repo signing key
  + The Feed Generator returns a skeleton of the feed to the user's PDS
  + The PDS hydrates the feed (user info, post contents, aggregates, etc.)
  + In the future, the PDS will hydrate the feed with the help of an App View, but for now, the PDS handles hydration itself
  + The PDS returns the hydrated feed to the user
- for users, this should feel like visiting a page in the app. Once they subscribe to a custom algorithm, it will appear in their home interface as one of their available feeds.
