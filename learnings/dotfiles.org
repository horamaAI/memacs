* Intro
** Notes
- alternative to symlinking the machine's configuration files with its $HOME/*
- better to split user and hostname-based configurations containing configuration files based on target environment and specific configurations : ==user, server, common, private, public, work, work-a, etc.==
  + for ease of use and retrieval, better to add target's specific configuration files into these configuration directories, eg: ~user/configuration-file~
